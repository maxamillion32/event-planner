## Event Planner

This is a small event-planner app for my udacity project.  I used material design lite, font-awesome, and firebase to create it.

[Demo](https://swanky-event-planner.firebaseapp.com/)

# To install

Run 'npm install' and 'bower install'

# To Build

You can run 'gulp' to run all of the development build routines.  This will also generate documentation.  It will serve the event planner app at localhost:8080 and it will serve the documentation at localhost:8800/index.html

You can run 'gulp dist' to build the distro, and gulp 'serve-dist' to serve te distro at localhost:8880

# To Clean

Run 'gulp dev-clean' to remove all files from the dev directory and 'gulp dist-clean' to remove all files from the dist directory.
